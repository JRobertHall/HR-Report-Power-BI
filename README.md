# HR-Report-Power-BI

Descriptive (what happened) and diagnostic (why things happened) analytics provide HR professionals and business leaders with powerful information that allows them to make sense of large amounts of data collected over the past years and identify areas of improvement.

The benefits of using Power BI for HR analytics are substantial and can significantly impact an organizationâ€™s HR management practices. Power BI enables HR professionals to easily monitor workforce metrics, such as employee strength, attrition, and new hires, and understand employee distribution by location, years of experience, and experience band. It also allows for the monitoring of attrition trends and patterns across various demographics, as well as the analysis of new hires, hiring costs, and training hours delivered. 

HR professionals can identify problem areas and devise effective interventions, ultimately leading to higher productivity, improved employee retention, and a significant reduction in HR-related costs. 
A huge shoutout to @sean chandler for the expert guidance that allowed me to further build upon my Power BI skills to produce this human resources tool that provides insights about headcount, retention, and turnover for my dream fictional company, Chill the Duck Out.

This project included building an HR headcount report from start to finish, including modeling the data into a star schema using the Power Query Editor, building out DAX measures for headcount and employee retention & turnover, designing a custom layout, integrating interactive features like a slicer panel to save space within the tool, visual tooltips and designing a really cool cover page!
